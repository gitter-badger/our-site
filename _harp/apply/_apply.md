<h2 align='center'> HOW DO I APPLY FOR THE PROGRAMME?<h2>

### STEP 1

  Create a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account.

### STEP 2

  Complete the [Expression of Interest](http://www.foundersandcoders.com/apply/interest.html) form.


  When we receive your Expression of Interest, we will invite you to our Coding for Everyone community on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone). Please join us and introduce yourself.

  If you do not receive an invitation within 3 days, please resubmit your Expression of Interest, checking that you have entered your GitHub username accurately.

### STEP 3

  Join [Freecodecamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/).

### STEP 4

  Join [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/).

  Note: When joining Codewars, you will be asked to solve a basic coding exercise. If you cannot solve it, please skip this step and return to it when you have spent a few hours practising [Basic JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map-aside#nested-collapseBasicJavaScript) on FreeCodeCamp.

  Note: You can easily use your GitHub account to join [Freecodecamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/) and [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/).

### STEP 5*

  [Create an empty repo](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) on GitHub, where you will eventually build your own one-page website.

### STEP 6

  A) Prepare an application video that answers these questions (if you do not want to video yourself, please do a screencast instead):

  1. Why do you want to join the programme?
  2. What problem would you most like to solve with technology?
  3. What do you intend to do when you finish?
  4. What really motivates you?

### Please:
  * Make sure you keep it to under two minutes.
  * Use YouTube or Vimeo or a similar service.
  * Record your voice at an adequate sound level.


  B) [Complete the application form](https://goo.gl/ENPIlD).

  <h3>Your application will be considered only after the closing date for applications, so you can continue to work on Codewars and Freecodecamp (See COURSE PREREQUISITES below) until that date.</h3>

  You can expect to hear from us within 14 days of the application closing date.

<h2 align='center'>COURSE PREREQUISITES<h2>
<h3> In order for your application to be considered, you should make sure you complete these three steps before the application closing date.</h3>
### 1)

  If you have not done any programming before, then you will probably need to allow yourself a minimum of 100 hours on Front End Development on http://www.freecodecamp.com/ before you are ready to tackle Codewars.

### 2)

  A) Aim to get to at least 5 kyu on https://www.codewars.com/ by the time the application window closes. We find that this process typically requires a minimum of 100 hours of study.

  B) Create at least one kata: https://www.codewars.com/kata/new/javascript.

### 3)

  Referring to step 5* from the instructions to apply for the programme, edit the repo you created to end up with one-page website on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). Your website can be about anything you like so pick a topic that you think is interesting!

  Note: We recommend not using frameworks or libraries like Bootstrap or jQuery. Also, using Jekyll is entirely optional.

  Other recommended materials can be found [here](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/recommended-materials).

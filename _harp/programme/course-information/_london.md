# London Programme

### Location and Directions
Founders & Coders London is located at 14 Palmers Road, E2 OSY, in Bethnal Green.

### Hours
Our London programme runs Monday through Friday from 10am to 6pm.

### Dates
We run three programmes a year, starting in February, June, and October.

### Eligibility
If you are over the age of 18 and can legally stay in the UK for six months, you are eligible to apply for our London programme.

We welcome international applicants who commit to spending at least six months in London. Please note that we cannot promise any financial support during the programme.

Founders & Coders has no academic requirements. We find that successful students are self-motivated, prepared to work long hours, and committed to collaborative working. Coding also requires a deep curiosity about how things work and a certain stubbornness in the face of repeated failure.

### Living Expenses
In the UK, we are a registered Learning Provider for Professional and Career Development Loans (PCDL) with registration number REG01-21442.

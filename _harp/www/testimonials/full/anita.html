  			  <p>I found my passion for coding during a trip to Argentina. I knew that this was the career for me. The thing with passion is that you just want to know everything as soon as possible. I began to self learn using various tutorials and spending a small fortune on books. However, I still felt a sense of frustration that I wasn&#39;t moving any further to where I wanted to be. That&#39;s when I came across Founders &amp; Coders. At first, I was sceptical: a 16-week course in javascriptâ€”for free. It was almost too good to be true.</p>
<p>Applying for the course was straightforward. This was a relief for me, as normally applying for a course has several stages with painful amounts of writing and interviews, whereas the Founders &amp; Coders application process was straight to the point. After a few weeks I received confirmation that I had been accepted onto the course, and, well, what can I say other than it&#39;s changed my life.</p>
<p>The course was intense, however as a group we all built a support network, enabling us to learn from each other and support each other when needed. The amount of knowledge I have gained from Founders &amp; Coders is immeasurable. There is no way I could have learnt what I did in such a short space of time on my own.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s not even the best bit! After several weeks free intensive learning, we were then able to sign up to build web apps for clients, which come through Founders &amp; Coders, and get paid to do so!!</p>
<p>For me, the future looks so much brighter and that&#39;s all thanks to Founders &amp; Coders.</p>
<p>I plan to stay around as long as possible.</p>

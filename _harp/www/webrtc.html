		<h1>WebRTC: democratising communication</h1><h2>Let us build a prototype for you</h2><p>Founders &amp; Coders and <a href="https://www.ipcortex.co.uk/">ipcortex</a> are excited to be collaborating to develop prototype services for the Third Sector. </p>
<p>We are looking for partners who are curious to explore ways to use real-time communication technology to find new and innovative ways to use instant messaging, screen sharing and video and audio chat to meet the needs of users. </p>
<p>All we need from you is your ideas, your enthusiasm, and knowledge of your users&#39; needs.</p>
<p>If you would like to participate in this pilot, please contact <a href="mailto:dan@foundersandcoders.com">Dan</a> or call us on 020 3585 2442.</p>
<p>Below, ipcortex CEO, Rob Pickering explains why he is so excited about WebRTC&mdash;real-time communications for the Web&mdash;and he outlines some of the ways it can be used.</p>
<hr>

<p>WebRTC is a technology that allows you to securely and conveniently conduct real-time peer-to-peer (person-to-person), or person-to-computer interactions via a website.</p>
<p>Without getting too much into the technical definition of &quot;real-time&quot;, this opens up new possibilities because it means that websites are no longer constrained to deliver time delayed interactions like filling in a contact form and getting a response some time later. They are also not constrained in allowing visitors to interact only with the website operator. The peer to peer bit means that a website can quickly become a rendezvous point where users come to communicate directly and personally with wider communities of support workers or peers.</p>
<p>It enables a moderately skilled non-specialist developer to quickly implement functionality on a website or mobile app for users to communicate with each other, or with you using audio, video, screensharing and data transfer in a very secure, convenient and technically reliable manner.</p>
<p>There is of course nothing new in many of these things: video chat over the internet, &quot;web chat&quot; buttons on websites, or screen sharing applications have been around for a while. Pre WebRTC, delivering this kind of functionality required a large team of specialist developers and technology resources which meant they they were beyond the reach of anyone but well funded commercial endeavours. Use of rich real-time interaction by organisations with real-world levels of resource tends to be restricted to framing external &quot;one size fits all&quot; commercial services in a corner of an otherwise traditional website which makes innovation either hard, expensive or both.</p>
<p>WebRTC democratises this away by removing the technical barriers. Web developers no longer need to be domain experts in real-time video, security, or Internet traffic engineering but can instead start fully integrating the technology on your website in innovative ways after a relatively short learning curve.</p>
<p>It is very early days for WebRTC, browser support is partial, and many of the core standards have yet to be formally signed off. It is however currently in production use by some very large services like <a href="https://bloggeek.me/facebook-messages-webrtc/">Facebook Messenger</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201540070">Amazon Mayday</a> etc, and there are also many more genuinely innovative initiatives at a proof of concept stage. To give you some ideas on the art of the possible, here are a few that I&#39;ve come across:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://myoncalldoc.com/home">My on-call Doc</a> : Commercial service in the US which allows on-demand medical consultations via video</li>
<li><a href="https://www.pawsquad.com/">Pawsquad</a> : like above but for pets</li>
<li><a href="https://yopet.us/">YoPet</a> : More pets, talking to lonely ones this time</li>
<li><a href="https://tech.ipcortex.co.uk/blog/rtcemergency1 RTCEmergency">RTCEmergency</a> : allows real-time video feed to emergency services responders from the scene of an incident (this is shameless self promotion as it was developed by my day-job team at ipcortex a few years ago)</li>
<li><a href="https://tech.ipcortex.co.uk/blog/keevioeye">KeevioEye</a> another example from my own experience, this time demonstrating that peer to peer doesn&#39;t just mean person to person, it can be person to thing!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.veeting.com/en/blog/post/case-study-video-conferencing-enables-sign-language-lessons">Veeting ASL case study</a> Using video conferencing to teach sign language.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last one where a generic video conferencing tool has been used for something neat does demonstrate the advantages of using real-time video interactions but could actually be taken so much further! One of the big advantages of WebRTC is that you are not stuck with generic services but can instead imagine solutions that contextualise the real-time communication within your application or website to provide a joined up experience that flows the communication seamlessly.</p>
<p>Imagine a sign language teaching website that stepped you through a sequence of canned training video exercises which don&#39;t require any interaction with someone else, but at the end of each segment where you have completed a set of exercises the &quot;video&quot; becomes a connection to a individual trainer on whom you can practice your newly acquired skills. Having problems with part of the sequence, the trainer can use their interface to select an exercise for you before moving on to the next student who needs help while you practice on your own. No trainers available? pop a query into a community and be connected with a peer who wants to practice the same part of the vocab and do some instant peer learning.</p>
<p>Contextual communication is therefore the key to delivering really neat new services. There is a world of customised applications that can be built. Here are just a few features of WebRTC that I think may be useful:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Security and anonymity</em>: WebRTC has strong security for media streams in transit and it is possible to connect users peer to peer, or through a proxy, in a way that makes it extremely hard to determine the identity and location of the other party. It is possible to deliver services that provide guaranteed one-way video. Could these features be useful in a counselling environment, allowing for example anonymous counselling where the client can see the counsellor but not vice-versa, and neither can obtain the identity of the other party?</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Telephone calls</em>: terminate telephone calls straight into a browser - build client services using a bank of volunteers sitting at home or an office with nothing more than a computer and a web-browser. Volunteers don&#39;t need to use their own telephones, and will only receive calls when actively on-duty and logged into your application which can also guide their conversations. Calls can be recorded and logged to meet safeguarding and regulatory requirements.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Multi-leg transactions</em> build an on-demand service for the hearing impaired which connects up volunteer sign language translators who participate in an audio conversation on one leg and sign back to the client via a video session or text chat.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The above is based on a few minutes of thinking, it definitely isn&#39;t exhaustive and doesn&#39;t really scratch the surface. WebRTC can be used to add unique new communication experiences for many organisations, but it&#39;s accessibility as a technology will be especially profound in the third sector. Whether your vision is simply to add audio and video chat to an existing community website, or something more contextual and ambitious, these are now much easier to do.</p>
<p>What is your communication or organisational resource problem, could you solve it by enabling real-time communication between staff, volunteers and clients via your website?</p>
